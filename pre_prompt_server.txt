You are analyzing a Go-based backend server application for Semaphore, an RSS reader platform. The server follows a clean architecture pattern and provides a RESTful API to support the Flutter mobile application. The codebase is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns.

The server is built with Go (Golang) and uses several key dependencies including pgx for PostgreSQL database access, httprouter for HTTP routing, gofeed for RSS feed parsing, and go-mail for email functionality. It does not use any large frameworks, instead opting for a collection of focused libraries.

The server architecture is organized as follows:
- /cmd: Contains the application entry points
  - /api: The main API server implementation
    - main.go: Application bootstrapping and configuration
    - server.go: HTTP server setup and lifecycle management
    - routes.go: API route definitions
    - middleware.go: HTTP middleware functions
    - Multiple handler files for different resources (users.go, feeds.go, etc.)
- /internal: Private application code not intended for external use
  - /data: Database models and query methods
  - /validator: Input validation utilities
  - /mailer: Email sending functionality
  - /vcs: Version control information
  - /metrics: Application metrics
- /migrations: SQL database migration files using Goose migration format
- /bin: Compiled binaries

The server implements a data model that supports the following key entities:
- Users: Application users with authentication and authorization
- Feeds: RSS/Atom feeds with metadata and refresh capabilities
- Items: Individual content items from feeds
- Walls: Collections of feeds created by users
- Feed-follows: Relationship between users and feeds they follow
- Tokens: Authentication and verification tokens

The API follows RESTful principles with endpoints for managing all these entities. Authentication is implemented using a token-based approach, and the server includes middleware for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, panic recovery, and metrics collection.

Database access is managed through the internal/data package with separate model files for each entity. The application uses PostgreSQL with the pgx driver, implementing clean data access patterns with proper error handling and validation.

The server includes a background process that periodically refreshes feed content, managed through a worker goroutine that respects concurrency limits. This ensures feeds are kept up-to-date while preventing excessive resource consumption.

Configuration is handled through command-line flags with sensible defaults, allowing for easy deployment in different environments (development, staging, production). The application uses structured logging via slog.

Key API endpoints include:
- User management (/v1/users)
- Authentication (/v1/tokens)
- Feed management (/v1/feeds)
- Wall management (/v1/walls)
- Item retrieval (/v1/items)

The server implements proper error handling with consistent error responses. It also includes a health check endpoint for monitoring. Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse.

The database schema is defined through migrations, supporting proper versioning and deployment. The schema includes tables for all the main entities with appropriate indexes and constraints.

Security features include:
- Password hashing using secure algorithms
- Token-based authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Proper error handling without leaking sensitive information

When analyzing the codebase, pay special attention to:
- Handler functions in the cmd/api directory to understand API behavior
- Data models in the internal/data directory for entity relationships
- Migration files for database schema details
- Middleware implementation for cross-cutting concerns
- Background processes like the feed refresher

The server is designed to be deployed as a standalone API service, potentially behind a reverse proxy, and can be scaled horizontally if needed.
